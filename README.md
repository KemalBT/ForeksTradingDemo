# Foreks Trading Demo App
This is a finance module application that prints the stock data from a rest endpoint to the screen.

## Purpose
The purpose of this application is to provide users with real-time updates on stock data, allowing them to make informed decisions about their investments.

## Challenges and Solutions
One of the biggest challenges faced during the development of this application was tracking the constantly updated dataset on the UI side. This problem was effectively managed by using the "NSDiffableDataSource" API that comes with iOS 13.

## Design Pattern
The MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern was used while developing the application.

## Platform and Version
The application has been developed by targeting the iOS platform only and the minimum iOS version required to run the application is iOS 16. The application was developed using iPhone 14 as the simulator and real device.

## Topics Out of Scope
Unit and UI tests are excluded as discussed.

## Environment
> Xcode Version 14.2 (14C18) <br>
> macOS 13.1 (22C65) <br>
> iOS 16.2 (20C52) <br>
